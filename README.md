# Movies-ETL

## Overview:

The project creates an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. After, we will create one function that takes in the three filesâ€”Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the Movies rating data and performs transformation and saves the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Results:
